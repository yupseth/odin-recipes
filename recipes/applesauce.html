     <h2>There is nothing like a batch of homemade applesauce! Our homemade applesauce recipe is so good, it is a revelation. Use fresh apples and add seasonings to make it your own.</h2>
      <p>Nothing beats the taste of homemade applesauce, and it's so easy to make! Every year, starting in mid summer with the Gravensteins, and through late fall with Granny Smiths and Fuji apples, my father processes dozens of batches of applesauce from apples picked from his trees. 
        He freezes them in large quart-sized mason jars for us to enjoy all year long.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>apples</li>
          <li>lemon</li>
          <li>cinnamon</li>
          <li>sugar</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>
            Boil apples:
            Place the peeled, cored, and quartered apples into a large pot. 
            Add the strips of lemon peel, the lemon juice (or vinegar), cinnamon, sugar, water and salt.</li>
          <li>
            Remove lemon peels, and mash the apples:
            Once the apples are cooked through, remove the pot from the heat. Remove the lemon peels</li>
          <li>
            Use a potato masher to mash the cooked apples in the pot to make a chunky applesauce. For a smoother applesauce you can either run the cooked apples through a food mill, or pur√©e them using a stick blender or a standing blender.</li>

      </ol>
