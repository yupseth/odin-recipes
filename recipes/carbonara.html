        <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350 g (12 oz) of spaghetti</li>
            <li>200 g (7 oz) of guanciale</li>
            <li>4 whole medium eggs (1 egg each yeld)</li>
            <li>100 g (1 cup + 1 tablespoon) of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>STEPS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1:</li>
              <p>First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for every 100 g / 3.50 oz of pasta and 15 g (1 tablespoon) of coarse salt per liter (4 cups) of water.
            Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slices … as you prefer) then simmer in a frying pan over medium heat for about 2 or 3 minutes. Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the guanciale cooks, the more its fats melt and its meat becomes crunchy. The cooking level is up to you, according to your tastes. 
            There are those who love well-cooked guanciale, while those who prefer it soft. </p>
            <li>Step 2:</li>
              <p>Now whisk the Pecorino Romano (which is a very salty and tasty Italian cheese so there’s no need to add salt) with the eggs.   </p>
            <li>Step 3:</li>
              <p>Add a little bit of ground black pepper. Stir quickly with a fork – or a hand whisk until you get a creamy sauce.</p>
            <li>Step 4:</li>
              <p> Cook the spaghetti al dente, following the cooking time found on the pasta packaging.
                Then put them in the frying pan, OVER HIGH HEAT, to season them properly with the fat of the guanciale.</p>
            <li>Step 5:</li>
              <p>Serve immediately</p>
        </ol>
